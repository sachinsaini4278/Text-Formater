# Installation 
The first thing we need to do is install some programs on our machine so to be able to start working with Django. The basic setup consists of installing Python and Django.
Django can be downloaded using pip as it is a python package .
<h5>pip install django </h5>

<h3 >   Starting a New Project</h3>

We are making text formater website. Open command prompt and go to the directory in which you are making your project using CD command. 

<h5>        django-admin startproject textformater</h5>

Django comes with a simple web server installed. It’s very convenient during the development, so we don’t have to install anything else to run the project locally. We can test it by executing the command:
	
 <h5>      python manage.py runserver</h5>


Open browser and go to your server : “http://127.0.0.1:8000/”  is successfully made then it will show the successful page.
Create a views.py file in textformater directory in which urls.py,settings.py files exist. For writing your python codes for your website. Just start writing codes in views.py file and create templates.

I used Bootstrap and HTML for creating webpage and also used templates in django for use these pages.
